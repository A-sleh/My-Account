# Demo Portfolio Application

## 🎯 Project Overview
A **high-performance**, **fully accessible** portfolio website built as a technical demonstration. This project prioritizes **Core Web Vitals optimization** and **WCAG accessibility standards** while structuring a complete, multi-section developer portfolio . It serves as a practical exercise in modern web performance and inclusive design principles.

## 🏗️ Website Structure
The site is organized into six distinct, semantic sections:
1.  **Hero Section** – Immediate introduction with name, role, and key statement.
2.  **About Me** – Detailed personal and professional background.
3.  **Skills** – Technical proficiencies in modern web development stacks.
4.  **Why Hire Me** – Highlights of key soft skills and work ethic.
5.  **Projects** – A showcase of completed web development work.
6.  **Contact** – Clear and accessible contact information and links.

## 🚀 Primary Technical Objectives

### 1. Core Web Vitals Excellence
This project is engineered to achieve top-tier scores in Google's Core Web Vitals, the critical metrics for user experience:
-   **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Optimized for fast loading of the main content.
-   **First Input Delay (FID) / Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: Ensured immediate responsiveness to user interactions.
-   **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Built for exceptional visual stability to prevent frustrating layout jumps.

### 2. Accessibility (a11y) First
Designed to be perceivable, operable, and understandable for all users, adhering to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG):
-   **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), landmarks, and ARIA attributes where necessary.
-   **Keyboard Navigation**: Full operability using only a keyboard.
-   **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Clear structure and descriptive alt text for images.
-   **Sufficient Color Contrast**: Text and interactive elements meet contrast ratio standards.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Development Focus
-   **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 (Focus on efficient rendering and minimal bundle size)
-   **Performance Tools**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest, Chrome DevTools (For audit and optimization)

## 📋 Content Note
**Important**: This is a **practice/demonstration project**. The personal details, project descriptions, and "Lorem Ipsum" text are **placeholder content** used solely to create a realistic structure for applying performance and accessibility techniques. The primary value lies in the underlying code quality and achieved metrics.

## 🧪 Performance & Audit
To evaluate the project's success against its core goals:
1.  Run a **Lighthouse Audit** (in Chrome DevTools) for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO scores.
2.  Check real-world performance data on **PageSpeed Insights**.
3.  Test navigation using a **screen reader** (NVDA, VoiceOver) and **keyboard-only** controls.
